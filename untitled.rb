question:
in def + method how do both numbers run at the same time? also, there is no . before the + sign
yet it works

answer:
it is implicit in ruby that there is a .(    ) when a method is being called
object.name_of_method(something_being_passed_in)

@number is 2

essentially its @number.+(3)
because other(the + parameter) is the three object and three.number is the integer 3
2 is calling the method + which takes 1 parameter (three.number) which is 3
2.+(3)
5
